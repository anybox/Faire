## Intro

Let's freaking do it

If you're here, you probably have an idea of what Event Sourcing can do.

Event Sourcing is the solution to every single problem you might have. 
It has no disadvantage whatsoever. It fits to every use case. 

Some says it even cures baldness.

Well... spoiler alert... that's not true.


If you think you should use Event Sourcing for your project, my first advice 
to you would be... think twice. And if after you double-think about it you're
still up for the adventure, but have now idea where to start, you're in the 
right place.

I like to think I'm a decently smart person. (Not to brag or anything, but 
recently I made a jigsaw puzzle on which box was written "3 year and more"
and it only took my six month). Though, I also like when complex topics are
explained simply. With one bit of complexity at a time. And building up 
gradually. I've always find that kind of walk through was missing for a lot
of topics. So I decided to write one.


All joke aside, this project and articles going with it are here to guide you
through the core concepts of Event Sourcing (and some other things I like, 
but one but at a time). In a manner that (that's the goal anyway) won't 
overwhelm you with complexity, nor bully you with acronyms without thorough
explanations.

We won't discuss whether or not you SHOULD use it for your project. Yet that's
definitely a question you should sleep upon.
